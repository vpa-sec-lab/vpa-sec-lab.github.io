							<h4>1. Enforcing skill behavior integrity throughout the skill life-cycle.</h4>
 
                            <p>
                            	 Our experiment shows that developers can arbitrarily change a skill’s functionality after the certification. We call this a content changing attack.
                            </p>	 
                            	 <!-- include videos of content changing attack-->
                            <p>
                            To prevent content changing attacks, a continuous certification/vetting process is required. Whenever the developer makes a change to either the front-end or back-end, a re-certification process should be performed. 	 
                            </p>

							<h4>2. Ensuring description-to-functionality fidelity.</h4>
 								<!-- include image of our skill with disclaimer-->
 								<!-- include image of user comments about this-->
                            <p>
                            	A skill’s full description describes the functionality and usage of the skill and may also include what data will be collected.
                            </p>	 
                            <p>
                            The minimum number of characters should be increased so that the developers are forced to explain the complete functionality that gives a better understanding about the skill and also can later be used by Amazon to check the consistency of the actual skill functionality against whats mentioned in the description.	
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                            VA platform providers may develop a tool to automatically measure the description- to-functionality fidelity of existing skills in VA marketplaces.
                            </p>

                            <h4>3. Automated skill testing</h4>
 								<!-- include image of session counter in code-->
 								<!-- include image of slots and slot types-->
                            <p>
                            	To strictly enforce security policies in the certification process, it is desirable to design a voice-based testing tool to automate the testing of third-party skills
                            </p>	 
                            <p>
                            VA platform providers may apply deep learning techniques to train a user simulation model to interact with third-party skills during the vetting.	
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                            However, to fundamentally address the problem, VA platform providers need to require skill developers to provide the permissions to view their back-end code. In this case, a code analysis can be performed, which could greatly increase the strength of the certification process.                            </p>
