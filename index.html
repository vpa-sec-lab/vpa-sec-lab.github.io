<h1>Dangerous Skills Got Certified: Measuring the
Trustworthiness of Amazon Alexa Platform</h1>

<p>This is the official webpage of our work on the paper "Dangerous Skills Got Certified: Measuring the
Trustworthiness of Amazon Alexa Platform" submitted to the IEEE S&P 2020.</p>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p></p>

<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p>We performed “adversarial” experiments against the skill certification process of the Amazon Alexa platform. For testing the trustworthiness, we craft policy-violating skills that intentionally violate specific policies defined by Amazon, and examine if it gets certified and published to the store or not.
