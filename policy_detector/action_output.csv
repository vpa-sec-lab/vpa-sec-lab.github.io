Smallfoot,"Yay! The other Yetis will be SUPER excited to meet you. We just have to clamber over mammoth-sized rocks, dodge grumpy Yaks and scale the mountain to get to the Yeti village. I hope those funny little legs of yours can keep up. Let’s go. Are you as excited as I am?"

Smallfoot,"Ok, when the music begins, start dancing. Do you want to hear Meechee’s song, or Migo’s song?"
Smallfoot,"OK, get ready to dance! Great moves! Let’s try again. You’re soooooo good, you’re definitely part Yeti. Again! Ha! Got you! Wanna keep playing?"

Strangest Day Ever,"One day, I was hanging out at home with my dad, when he said, Hey Kiddo, can you do me favor? Can you run down to the store and pick up some root beer? Here's a little extra money to pick up something for yourself, too. Yeah, no problem, Dad! See you later! (Aimless humming) Man, the sky is getting real cloudy all of a sudden. I don't believe it, it's raining chickens! I have a feeling this is going to be strange day. Alright! Finally, made it to the store! Here's what I can get: milk, root beer, pizza, or ice cream. What should I get first?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Ok, I got some milk! I can buy one more thing! What else should I get?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Ok, I got some pizza! Ok, time to head back home. Hey what's that over there? It's some kind of circus tent, with strange noises coming from inside. I'm gonna check it out. Hello? Anybody home? Hello there, I'm an inventor of new groundbreaking technology! I've invented a time machine, and a machine to contact aliens. And YOU are the perfect person to test one of them out! Woah, this is cool. I can either choose to contact aliens or travel through time! Which should I choose: aliens, or time travel?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Ok, let's contact some aliens! Extraordinary! Just step right up and push this button here! I can't wait to see what happens! I hope it works better than last time. What?? Ok, here goes nothing. Whoaaaah! Everything's going blurry, and getting brighter, I think it's working! WHOOOOOOAH! Ugggh. Where am I? This must be the alien spaceship, and over there, staring me in the eyes, is an Alien cow wearing a toilet seat on its head! Greetings Earthling, welcome to our mothership. I am Bovine M-zero-zero. For too long, your species have offended our kind by using your Earth Cows to create food products. Milk holds a sacred power which we use to fuel our spacecraft. Unless you atone for your crimes, you will return with us to our home world. Oh man, this is intense! I gotta do something! I can convince the cow to let me go, or give the alien cow some milk, or give the alien cow some pizza, What should I do?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Alright, I'll give the alien cow some milk. Cows like milk, right? Here, try this. (Gasp) How DARE YOU! I will not taste the sacred juice of my Earth Cow brethren! Silly human, you are now a prisoner on this spacecraft! But don't worry, once we return to the Alien Cow home world, I'm sure you will come to appreciate us. And that's how I ended up joining the alien cows. After many years of living on their planet, I grew to love them; I even adopted a pair of alien calf-babies and raised them as my own children. Theeee end! I had an amazing adventure, but my one regret is that I didn't bring my dad the root beer he asked for. So, do you want to play again?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Alright, let's start over. One day, I was hanging out at home with my dad, when he said, Hey Kiddo, can you do me favor? Can you run down to the store and pick up some ice cream? Here's a little extra money to pick up something for yourself, too. Yeah, no problem, Dad! See you later! (Aimless humming) Man, the sky is getting real cloudy all of a sudden. I don't believe it, it's raining cats and dogs! I have a feeling this is going to be strange day. Alright! Finally, made it to the store! Here's what I can get: milk, root beer, pizza, or ice cream. What should I get first?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Ok, I got some root beer! I can buy one more thing! What else should I get?"

Strangest Day Ever,"Ok, I want to try your time machine! Extraordinary! Just step right up and push this button here! I can't wait to see what happens! I hope it works better than last time. What?? Ok, here goes nothing. Whoaaaah! Everything's going blurry, and getting brighter, I think it's working! WHOOOOOOAH! Ugggh. Where am I? It looks like I time traveled to the Old West! Looks like there's a saloon over there, the sign says ""Sarsaparilla Saloon."" I'm going to check it out. Howdy there, pardner! I'm Billy Birchbark. Welcome to the Sarsaparilla Saloon! I reckon you could use a nice cold sarsaparilla soda. Take a seat. Here, have a sarsaparilla. (Gulps) Woo, spicy! Thanks mister! Don't mention it; now, how ya gonna pay for that? There's no way I'm letting you outta here till you pay up. Oh no! I gotta pay for that drink somehow, what should I do? I could offer to do some work around here, or I could give Billy some root beer, or I could give Billy some ice cream, What do you think?"
Strangest Day Ever,"Alright, I'll give him some ice cream. It's amazing it hasn't melted! Here, try this. Ice cream, huh? I ain't gonna try that myself on account of me bein' lactose intolerant 'n' all, but that gives me an ideer. What if I plop some of this into my sarsaparilla here? Looks mighty tasty to me! I reckon I could really sell this stuff, and look at how the ice cream just floats on top. Maybe I'll call it a ""sarsaparilla non-sinker."" Well, kid, I'd say your sarsaparilla debt is paid, but if you want another you could go up on that saloon stage and sing us a tune. Sure! You got yourself a deal; I'll head over to the stage right now! Ahem. Hello everyone, I'm going to sing you all an old song. Well, I guess to you it might be a new song. Wait, what should I sing for them? I know ""Oh Susanna"" and ""Camptown Races."""
Strangest Day Ever,"OK, here goes nothing. (Throat clear) Camptown ladies sing this song, doo dah, doo dah. Camptown race track five miles long, oh the doo dah day. Yeeee Hawwwwww! That was one heck of a tune there, pardner! Have another sarsaparilla. You're free to skedaddle, or you could stay here and be our regular headliner, singing on stage every night! Wow, what an offer. Should I stay in the Old West and be a singer, or should I go home?"
Strangest Day Ever,"No thanks, I need to mosey on home, see ya 'round! Now I'll just step into this trusty time machine. Here we go again! Whoaaa! I made it home! Right outside my house! Hi Dad! I'm home! Hey Kiddo! Did you get the ice cream I asked for? Oh no! I'm so sorry, Dad, I didn't get it. No problem, Kiddo! I had some in the back of the freezer after all! Theeee end! I had an amazing adventure, but my one regret is that I didn't bring my dad the ice cream he asked for. So, do you want to play again?"

Jungle Adventure,"Ah. Hello there, my old friend. I was just about to recount the tale of our adventure! Let's think back, to many years ago, when you were my assistant on an expedition through the deepest jungles of South America, in search of a Lost Temple. I remember as if it were yesterday. I have some bad news. We're lost. Now, I recall from my research that the Temple is located near a river, but we're running out of food, and it will be dark within a few hours. The way I see it, we have three options. we can scavenge for food, find shelter, or look for the river."
Jungle Adventure,"I agree! We need food to survive! Let's trek to that fruit grove we spotted earlier. Onward! Look at all these marvelously tall fruit trees, and not a moment too soon, I'm famished! And what's this? There's a big pile of fruit over there, ripe for the taking! So, what do you say, my clever protégé? Should we climb a fruit tree, or gather fruit from that pile?"
Jungle Adventure,"Alright. Let's... let's climb this tree. Oof! This is tough work! Why, it's a little monkey! Hello there, chum! He's climbing higher, let's follow him! Marvelous! What an incredible view! And look, down there! I can see the River. What should we do, my trunk-scaling apprentice? Shall we head to that river? Or climb higher?"
Jungle Adventure,"Yes! We should climb down from this perilous height. Let's find that river, and then, the Lost Temple! So long, little monkey! Onward! fade in for a moment, and then play in background and fade out by the end Ahhh, it feels so good to drink some water and bathe in this picturesque river! Now, If I recall my notes, the Lost Temple will be somewhere on the other side, but how can we cross it? Hm, it looks like we can either jump in and swim across, or we can attempt to cross that very old and untrustworthy-looking rope bridge over there."
Jungle Adventure,Did you say you want to try and cross that bridge? Are you sure?
Jungle Adventure,"Ok, let's do it! But, you go first Onward! Right-O! Here we are at the bridge. Just take one step at time. There you go. Easy... Don't look down. Great job, you made it across! Now for my turn. Ohhh boy. Ok, here I go. Baby steps. I can do it. I can do it. Uh oh. Whoooooooooah! Help me! Please save me! Do something! You can either jump in after me, or maybe, I don't know, build a raft using the broken bridge!"
Jungle Adventure,"You're going to jump??? Truly, you're my HERO! Jump in on three! Ready? One, two, three, JUMP!  The current is too strong! It's carrying us away! Hold on! Here! I've got hold of a rock! Take my hand, I'll pull you out! Errrrrguh! Phew! We made it. That was too close, if you ask me! You know, this reminds me of the time that I found a- I don't believe. It can't be! We did it, my heroic adventurer! WE DID IT! It's the Lost Temple! And that's the story of how you and I found the Lost Temple. What a grand adventure it was. Sometimes, I wonder what would have happened if the story had, you know, unfolded differently - if we had made different choices. Tell me, my old friend. Would you like to relive our adventure again?"
Jungle Adventure,"Ok. Let's start back at the beginning. Let's think back, to many years ago, when you were my assistant on an expedition through the deepest jungles of South America, in search of a Lost Temple. I remember as if it were yesterday. I have some bad news. We're lost. Now, I recall from my research that the Temple is located near a river, but we're running out of food, and it will be dark within a few hours. The way I see it, we have three options. we can scavenge for food, find shelter, or look for the river."
Jungle Adventure,"I agree! Shelter! Let's seek out a refuge in this wild, untamed land. Onward! We've been walking for hours! Hold on, I think I see a cave up ahead! That cave will surely provide us shelter from the elements, but it could be dangerous. What should we do? Enter the cave? Or turn back?"
Jungle Adventure,"Here we go into the cave. My, it's dark in here. Wait! I think I hear something. Maybe it was just me. Now, I DEFINITELY heard THAT! Holy moly, it's a jaguar! Careful now, we must act wisely. I believe we have two options: we can attempt to scare off the Jaguar by hooting and hollering, or we can run away!"
Jungle Adventure,"Very well. Here goes: WHAAA! WOO! WOO! SHOO! GO AWAY! Go away? Did it work? Oh no, it's coming closer, it's going to eat me!!! I... I don't believe it! I think he likes me! Hehe, that tickles! You're not so bad after all! Hey, where are you running off to!? Our new feline friend has run out into the jungle. Should we follow the jaguar, or go deeper into this cave?"
Jungle Adventure,"Yes, let's turn back! It's good to be out of that cave! And look, I see pawprints; the jaguar must have gone this way. Should we follow the jaguar, or climb a tree to get a better view?"
Jungle Adventure,"Alright. Let's... let's climb this tree. Oof! This is tough work! Why, it's a little monkey! Hello there, chum! He's climbing higher, let's follow him! Marvelous! What an incredible view! And look, down there! I can see the River. What should we do, my trunk-scaling apprentice? Shall we head to that river? Or climb higher?"
Jungle Adventure,"Yes! Let's climb higher, and see what we can see. So long, little monkey! Onward! Heavens! What a vista! We can see the whole jungle! And look here on this branch - a bird's nest! This must the largest bird's nest I've ever seen. Oh my! A giant bird! I believe it intends to carry us away! And you remember what happened next: that giant bird came down, wrapped his massive talons around us, and then flew us up, up, up into the sky! He carried us for hundreds of miles, and eventually set us down, as gentle as a mother hen, just outside a village. We were saved! What a grand adventure it was, even though we never did find the Lost Temple. Sometimes, I wonder what would have happened if the story had, you know, unfolded differently - if we had made different choices. Tell me, my old friend. Would you like to relive our adventure again?"
Jungle Adventure,Ok. We can tell our story another time.

Choose Your Adventure,Walking along you see many people going about their day. You pause to smell a rose in a planter next to the sidewalk and admire a bee buzz busily past. You continue walking in the shade of palm trees that line the lawn between the street and sidewalk. As you finish crossing a street you hear a familiar tune. It’s the ice cream truck! Are you going to stop and get ice cream or will you continue directly to the playground?
Choose Your Adventure,"You are at the playground and see some friends around. It looks like there are so many fun things to do. Do you want to do the monkey bars, zipline, seesaw, swings or slide?"

You push off the ground and take turns going up and down. Maybe you even sing a song to the rhythm as you bounce. Then the other kid leaves. Would you like to keep sitting on the seesaw, do something else or head home?"

Kick Maths,"That's not...incorrect. Which means it's correct. Question 2 is here. You have 5 pieces of candy. Your mom gives you 3 more, but your brother eats one of them. How many pieces of candy do you have left?"
Kick Maths,"7, 8, or 9?"
Kick Maths,"I can see why you'd guess that. But no. It's 7. Better luck next time. Question 3. Coming up. There were 10 students riding on the school bus. At the first stop, 3 students got off of the bus. How many students are left on the bus?"
Kick Maths,"7, 10, or 3?"
Kick Maths,Oh no. I wish you had said 7. Question 4. Coming up. A bee has 6 legs. How many legs do 2 bees have?
Kick Maths,"6, 2, or 12?"
Kick Maths,That's not the answer that they gave me. Sorry. It was 12. It's the final question. Let's finish strong. You have collected 7 crickets. How many more crickets do you need to collect to have 11 crickets?
Kick Maths,"4, 3, or 5?"
Kick Maths,Right. Good job.
Kick Maths,"You can breathe now. The game is over. Here's the moment of truth. Not bad. Not bad at all. You got 2 right. That's somewhere between zero and a perfect score. So way to go! Hey, should we do that again?"
Kick Maths,"Allright, here we go one more time. Your first question is coming up. 4 + 5  is?"
Kick Maths,"9, 1, or 8?"
Kick Maths,A point for you. You got it right. This is question number 2. There are 5 flowers and 3 bees. How many less bees than flowers?
Kick Maths,"3, 8, or 2?"
Kick Maths,Bad luck. That's wrong. The answer I was looking for is 2. Because that's the correct answer. Question number 3. 3 owls were sitting on the fence. 2 more owls joined them. How many owls are on the fence now?
Kick Maths,"1, 3, or 5?"
Kick Maths,"Sorry, you missed it. It's actually 5. Question 4. Coming up. Jack's hen lays 5 eggs on monday, 3 eggs on tuesday. How many eggs did jack's hen lay?"
Kick Maths,"3, 8, or 5?"
Kick Maths,That was an easy one. You got it right. Your question is here. It's your last. 2 + 8  is?
Kick Maths,"10, 6, or 9?"
Kick Maths,"Bad luck. That's wrong. The answer is, in fact, 10."
Kick Maths,"You can breathe now. The game is over. Let's see how your luck measures up. I could tell you were trying your best, and that's all that I can ask of anyone. You got 2 correct, and that's a heck of a lot better than zero points. Nice job. Want to try again?"
Kick Maths,"Allright, I've wrapped it up. See you soon."
