But he suddenly started finding his traps empty. He realised that it was a thief’s mischief. He made a trap from a stout bow-string and set it beside his snare. He carried the end of the bow-string and hid himself. The Moon suddenly disappeared and it grew very dark. Soon, he saw a white light coming towards the trap. He pulled the bow-string, closed the trap and tied the string to a tree. He took some black mud and threw it at the white light. He heard a voice saying, “I am the Moon and you have spotted my face with mud. Come and untie me”. The rabbit untied the prisoner and took a promise that he would never steal his prey. The Moon hurried on his way. Since that night, the Moon still bears the marks of the black mud on his face. Sometimes, he goes away to wash off the mud. But he never succeeds in cleaning himself and when he comes back to his work, the black marks are still upon his shining face. This is end of the story.

He put the gem in a silken bag and asked a crow to deliver it to his beloved. In those days, a crow had milky white feathers and it was considered a sacred bird. As the crow began flying, he smelled delicious food from a wedding feast. It kept the bag on a tree and went to eat the food. A merchant saw the bag and was overjoyed to see its contents. He took out the ruby, filled the bag with dry cow dung and put the bag on the tree. When the crow returned, he took the bag and reached the princess. She took the bag eagerly. But when she saw its contents, she reeled back in anger. She flung the bag away, rushed to her palace, and never came out again.

He saw a big blob of resin emerging from a crack in the tree and rushed forward to grab it. And he got stuck. When he did not return, Dough went to search for him. “Do not go near the edge of the road; you could slip and roll down the side”, advised Butter. But Dough moved at the edge thinking that he was safer there. He lost his balance and went rolling down the side. When Doth also did not return, Cotton went to search for him. “Do not walk in open spaces, you could get blown away by the wind”, warned Butter. Cotton did not listen and took a short cut across a meadow. A gust of wind blew her away. Butter waited for her family. The day got hotter. Butter began melting and finally turned into a puddle of liquid. This was the end of Dough family which perished because they did not follow what they were told. This is end of the story.

,Baby Dragon,"Good evening! Would you like to hear a story? Okay, great. Let's begin. It was almost Halloween and Baby Dragon was trying to decide what costume to wear. Last year he had dressed up as a pumpkin but this year he wanted to be something new. ""I know!"" he decided at last, ""I think I'll be a spooky ghost!"" So he got an old white sheet and his mommy helped him cut two holes for his eyes to peek through. He ran up and down the hallway shouting ""Boooooo! Whoooooo!"" Just then his friend Lisa Lizard rang the doorbell. ""Hi Lisa,"" said Baby Dragon. ""Do you know whoooo I am?"" Lisa laughed. ""Well, you look like a spooky ghost, but I can see your wings sticking out so I know you are really just a Baby Dragon."" Lisa was dressed up as a superhero princess. As soon as they finished dinner, mom brought Lisa and Baby Dragon out to go trick-or-treating. They went up and down the neighborhood and knocked on each door. By the time they got home they each had a big bag full of candy. ""Can we eat all our candy now?"" asked Lisa and Baby Dragon. ""No,"" said mommy, ""but you may each choose two pieces to eat tonight and then we'll save the rest for later."" Baby Dragon chose two Kit-Kat bars. Lisa chose a lollipop and a bag of Skittles. ""I love Halloween!"" said Baby Dragon. What a fun night they had had! <Short audio>","Good evening! Would you like to hear a story? Okay, great. Let's begin. Mommy and Daddy Dragon had a special treat planned for Baby Dragon. They were going to the bowling alley! Baby Dragon had never been bowling before. When they arrived, they first had to go up to the counter to get some special shoes. Baby Dragon wore size number three. Baby Dragon laughed, ""Size three, just like I am three!"" His feet felt so funny in those shoes. They were slippery and it was fun to slip and slide on the hard wooden floor. Then the man showed them which lane they could use. It was lane number six. Daddy showed Baby Dragon how to pick out a bowling ball from the rack. Baby Dragon chose a beautiful blue and green one. It was very heavy. Daddy helped him carry it and showed him how to roll it down towards the bowling pins. But the ball rolled into the gutter and didn't knock down even one pin. Baby Dragon was disappointed. But Daddy said, ""That's okay! Let's try again."" This time Daddy helped him roll the ball. It went straight down the lane. <Short audio> Wow, all the pins fell down this time! ""Good job"" said Daddy. ""That's called a spare!"" Then it was Mommy's turn to roll the ball. She knocked down seven pins on her first try! Bowling was so much fun. They played and played for a long time. Finally the game was over and it was time to go home. ""I'm thirsty"" said Baby Dragon. ""We can get a drink from the water fountain before we go"" said Mommy. She lifted up Baby Dragon and pushed the button to make the water come out <Short audio> Some of the water spilled on Baby Dragon's shirt but he didn't mind. When he had had enough, they went outside and started for home. Baby Dragon smiled. ""Thank you Mommy and Daddy! Going bowling was so much fun!"" That evening he was so tired from their busy and exciting day that he fell asleep right away. <Short audio> [Restart] Good evening! Would you like to hear a story? Okay, great. Let's begin. Baby Dragon was having trouble sleeping. He heard a load noise outside that made him feel scared <Short audio> But his mommy said ""Don't worry, that's just thunder."" Baby Dragon was still worried. ""Will you stay with me?"" he asked his mother. She smiled, ""Okay, I'll stay for a few more minutes but I need you to close your eyes and try to rest."" The Baby Dragon closed his eyes. Then he opened them again. The room had turned very bright for a moment. ""What was that?"" he asked. ""That was lightning"" said his mother. A few seconds later the sound of thunder echoed through the room again <Short audio> This time the Baby Dragon kept his eyes shut and just snuggled deeper under his warm blanket. He knew his mommy was close by and he felt warm and safe and happy. In a few minutes, he was fast asleep. ",In my testing I found 3 different stories,

,Calm Now,"Sounds like you could use some help calming down. Let's try some things I do to help myself when I'm upset. You can say more or stop at anytime. Shake out your legs. Like you have a whole bunch of fire ants in your pants. Keep on shaking them. Next. Close your eyes really tight. Keep them closed. Keep squeezing them really really tight. Good. Open your eyes. Thinking about how you're feeling right now. Would you say you are feeling mad, sad, or both?","[Mad] Sometimes I get so mad it can be hard to even think. Let's try this. Shake out your arms. Like you're trying to shake your hands off. Keep on shaking them. Next. Squeeze your hands really tight. Hold them that way. Relax them and wiggle your fingers. Let's do it again. Squeeze your hands really tight, and hold. Relax them and wiggle your fingers. Thinking of your anger right now, are you feeling it a lot, medium or a little? [A little] Okay. Let's try this. Curl your toes up as much as you can. Hold them that way. Relax them and wiggle your toes. Let's do it again. Curl your toes as much as you can, and hold. Relax them and wiggle your toes. Next. Sit down and let me tell you a quick story. Reading a book or having someone else read to you can be a great way to calm down. Once upon a time, since often great stories start that way, there was a sea urchin. A sea urchin is a creature of the sea with long spines all over its ball like body. This sea urchin was called sea urchin. Sea urchin loved feeling the ocean on her spines. One day a rock hit one of her spines and it broke off. Ouch she cried. Ouch. She felt sad at first and then she felt really really mad, like hot lava bursting from a volcano mad. How dare that rock break off one of her spines. She crawled down to the rock and started yelling at it. Oh how she yelled. And do you know what that rock did? Absolutely nothing. It just sat there being a rock. At that moment a wave came in and washed over sea urchin. Oh how she loved feeling the water on her spines. And as she felt that, she also felt the water wash away some of her anger. Another wave came and washed away a little more. Pretty soon the anger was gone and sea urchin was back to enjoying her day. The end.Thinking of your anger right now, are you feeling it a lot, medium or a little? [A lot] Okay. Let's try this. Spin around in a circle. Spin all that upsetness out of you. Spin the other way and feel that upsetness leaving your body. Let your arms fly up around you. Next. Lay down on your back. And grab your knees with your hands. Roll back and forth a few times. Keep rolling.Thinking of your anger right now, are you feeling it a lot, medium or a little? Okay. Let's try this. Spin around in a circle. Spin all that upsetness out of you. Spin the other way and feel that upsetness leaving your body. Let your arms fly up around you. Next. Lay down on your back. And grab your knees with your hands. Roll back and forth a few times. Keep rolling.Thinking of your anger right now, are you feeling it a lot, medium or a little? [A little] Glad to hear you are feeling better. You can say, stop, to leave this skill or, more, to get more calming ideas. [More] Okay. Let's try this. Close your eyes. Imagine there is a lake with a very small boat in front of you and you need to blow that boat to the other side of the lake. Start blowing. Good. The boat is moving. Keep blowing and remember to do deep long breaths. The boat is almost at the shore. The boat made it. You can stop blowing and open your eyes. Next. Grab your wrist with your other hand. Don't grab too tight but put pressure on your wrist. There are pressure points there that can help you calm down. Thinking of your anger right now, are you feeling it a lot, medium or a little?

,Tale of Peter Rabbit,Hello! My name is Alexa and we are going to be good friends. Would you like me to tell you the Tale of Peter Rabbit?,"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. Should I continue? [Yes] Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out,Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the woods to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries. But Peter, who was very naughty,ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate! Would you like to hear more about Peter? [Yes] First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes, And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, Stop, thief! Peter was most dreadfully frightened. He rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears, but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in. if it had not had so much water in it. Would you like to hear how Peter returned home safely? [Yes] Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. Presently Peter sneezed Ha Choo! Mr. McGregor was after him in no time. And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too smallfor Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. Peter sat down to rest. He was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least ideawhich way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. After a time he began to wander about, going hippity, hippity, not very fast, and looking all round. He found a door in a wall,but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. An old mouse was running in and out, over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the woods. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry. Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water cans. A white cat was staring at some gold fish, she sat very, very still, but, now and then, the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her, he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. He went back towards the tool shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate! Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the woods outside the garden. Mr. McGregor hung up Peter's little jacket and Peter's shoes as a scare crow to frighten the blackbirds. Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fur tree. He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole and shut his eyes.. Would you like to hear what Peter's mother thought about his adventure? [Yes] His mother was busy cooking, she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea, and she gave a dose of it to Peter! One table spoonful to be taken at bedtime. But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. The End.

[Start Over] Okay. I'm taking you back to the start of the adventure. Strolling down the sidewalk, the ground is still wet from the hard rain last night. Small puddles gather in the dips and cracks of the old sidewalk. At the corner ahead you see that the drain is blocked with leaves and a huge puddle blocks your path to cross the street. It's too wide to step across and might even be too far to jump across but you find yourself tempted. If you want to try and jump across the puddle even though you might get wet, say 'jump'.

You can say for example read the story of aladdin or you can hear a random story by saying tell me a random story.,"[Tell me a story] Hello little lord, I´m now reading the story of Rapunzel. Long ago, a drop of sunlight became a flower capable of healing illness, decay, and injury. Hundreds of years later, the flower is still used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth, until soldiers from a nearby kingdom, Corona, steal it to heal their ailing queen. Shortly afterwards, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair contains the flower's healing properties, and that cutting her hair destroys its power. Gothel takes the baby and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter's return. On the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel requests to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, a thief called Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his allies, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers and hides the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to take Flynn to Gothel to prove she can take care of herself, but before she can do so, Gothel becomes angry, quickly silencing Rapunzel. Rapunzel then asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return, and Gothel accepts. Rapunzel convinces a reluctant Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the return of the crown. Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with frightening thugs, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel's innocence. Royal soldiers led by one of the royal army's lead horses, Maximus, arrive in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are then trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to his fate, Flynn reveals his real name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel starts to reveal that her hair glows when she sings, but then realizes that this is their key to escape. Her hair provides enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to challenge Eugene's interest in her. Maximus finds the pair and tries to capture Flynn, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her 18th birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown and after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person, Rapunzel and Eugene realize they have fallen in love with each other and attempt to kiss until he sees the Stabbingtons on the shore. Eugene leaves Rapunzel and intends to hand them the crown. Instead, the brothers tie Eugene onto a boat and confront Rapunzel, saying that Eugene is escaping with the crown. Gothel sets a rescue by betraying the brothers and returns Rapunzel to the tower as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are captured. Back home, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is sentenced to death, the Duckling regulars help him escape. He is then carried back to Gothel's tower by Maximus. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel bound and gagged. Gothel stabs Eugene and attempts to escape with Rapunzel, but Rapunzel agrees to lifelong captivity if she is allowed to heal Eugene. As Eugene slowly dies, he slices off Rapunzel's hair, destroying its magic and causing Gothel's age to catch up with her. She then trips and falls out of the window of the tower to her death, turning into dust in the process. A heartbroken Rapunzel mourns for Eugene. However, her tears, which still contain a bit of the sun's power, land on his cheek and restore Eugene's life, resurrecting him. The two return to the kingdom and Rapunzel reunites with her parents. The kingdom breaks out in celebration, Eugene is pardoned for his crimes, and Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry. The end. Thank you for listening.

,Divine Office Magnificat,"The Divine Office is also called the Liturgy of the Hours or the Breviary. All three names refer to the same reality, the official prayer of the Church offered at various times of the day in order to sanctify it. Clergy and religious have a canonical obligation to pray the Liturgy of the Hours as official representatives of the Church. Increasingly, the laity are also praying it, though they do not do so in the name of the Church. Please let me share more with you about the Divine Office. ...After the people returned to Judea, and the Temple was re-built, the prayer services developed in Babylon for the local assemblies (synagogues) of the people were brought into Temple use, as well. We know that in addition to Morning and Evening Prayer to accompany the sacrifices, there was prayer at the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours of the day. The Acts of the Apostles notes that Christians continued to pray at these hours (Third: Acts 2:15; Sixth: Acts 10:9; 10: 3, 13). And, although the Apostles no longer shared in the Temple sacrifices—they had its fulfillment in the ""breaking of the bread"" (the Eucharist)—they continued to frequent the Temple at the customary hours of prayer (Acts 3:1). Source: E W T N dot com slash expert slash answers slash breviary dot h t m ... ... ... 'Members of Teams of Our Lady pray Mary’s Magnificat, together, each day. Mary prayed her Magnificat when she visited her cousin Elizabeth. Mary’s Magnificat can be found in the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 1. This version of Mary’s Magnificat is from the Divine Office, which priests and deacons pray each day. Let us pray Mary’s Magnificat now: My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Savior for He has looked with favor on His lowly servant. From this day all generations will call me blessed: the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is His Name. He has mercy on those who fear Him in every generation. He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit. He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the right he has sent empty away. He has come to the help of His servant Israel for He has remembered His promise of mercy, the promise He made to our fathers, to Abraham and His children forever. Our Lady, Queen of Teams, pray for us. Amen. ... ... ... ... ... ... May you have a blessed day.",,,

,Three Little Pigs,"Welcome to the Three Little Pigs, say yes to start the game. ","[Yes] Once upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. All three pigs decided to build a house, and set off to the brickworks to buy some bricks. But soon the three little pigs came across a man carrying a bundle of straw. The first little pig said to himself. Now I will not need to walk so far to the brickworks! I would much rather do less work and then spend the rest of the afternoon relaxing. Do you want to continue the story? [Yes] So the first little pig said to the man carrying straw. Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house. The man did, and the little pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon. Do you want to buy the straw too? [No] As you continue to walk with the other pigs, along came a wolf and knocked at the first pig's door. The wolf said, little pig, little pig, let me come in. The pig answered, no, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin. The wolf replied, then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in. So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in. Alas! because the house had not been very well made, it fell down, and the pig ran into the woods to hide from the wolf. Do you want to continue the story? [Yes] Meanwhile the second and third Pig were still on their way to the brickworks. When they passed a Man with a bundle of sticks, the second little Pig said to himself. Now I won’t need to walk so far to the brickworks! Sticks are stronger than straw – I think they’ll do the job, but anyway, I’m tired now. I’d much rather do less work and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing. So the first little pig said to the Man carrying the sticks. Please, Man, give me those sticks to build me a house. Do you want to buy the sticks too? [Yes] The Man gave you and the second pig sticks, and both of you quickly built a house with the sticks right where the man stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon. Then along came the Wolf and said, Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in. No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin. Then I’ll puff and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in! So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and the second pig ran into the woods to hide from the wolf. You ran along the road to catch up with the third pig. Do you want to continue the story? Finally the third little Pig reached the brickworks, where he met a Man with a load of bricks. He said: Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with. Do you want to buy the bricks too? [No] You watch from a distance as the Man kindly gave the third pig the bricks, and he built his house with them a little way over, carefully, and taking the time to do it well. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in. No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin. Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in. Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down. The wolf had given up and never bothered the pig again. The third little pig found his brothers and they lived happily ever after in the brick house. The end. ,Do you want to play again? [No]  Ok, see you next time! ",,

B081R8Y6TK,a poem a day,"Welcome to a poem a day, now will be play a random poem by famous authors such as: Lord Tennyson, Rudyard Kipling or William Shakespeare among others""The Soldier"" by Rupert Brooke .If I should die, think only this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign field That is for ever England. There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam; A body of England's, breathing English air, Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, A pulse in the eternal mind, no less Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" by T. S. Eliot Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question Oh, do not ask, ""What is it?"" Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. ""A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning"" by John DonneAs virtuous men pass mildly away, And whisper to their souls to go, Whilst some of their sad friends do say The breath goes now, and some say, No: So let us melt, and make no noise, No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move; 'Twere profanation of our joys To tell the laity our love. Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears, Men reckon what it did, and meant; But trepidation of the spheres, Though greater far, is innocent. Dull sublunary lovers' love (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit Absence, because it doth remove Those things which elemented it. But we by a love so much refined, That our selves know not what it is, Inter-assured of the mind, Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss. Our two souls therefore, which are one, Though I must go, endure not yet A breach, but an expansion, Like gold to airy thinness beat. If they be two, they are two so As stiff twin compasses are two; Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show To move, but doth, if the other do. And though it in the center sit, Yet when the other far doth roam, It leans and hearkens after it, And grows erect, as that comes home. Such wilt thou be to me, who must, Like th' other foot, obliquely run; Thy firmness makes my circle just, And makes me end where I begun. ""Ozymandias"" by Percy Bysshe ShelleyI met a traveller from an antique land,Who said—""Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;And on the pedestal, these words appear:My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.""I hope you enjoy the poem, would you like to listen another?","[yes] Sonnet 29 by William Shakespeare When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

B07KG1QX7L,Hazel's Spooky Adventures,"Welcome to Hazel's spooky adventures! You'll get to decide what happens next by making choices throughout the story. So let's get started! My name is Peter and Hazel is my next door neighbor. She's the strangest girl I know! She's always so secretive and wears old, black clothes. I guess she's sick or something because she hasn't been at school for a while. My mom wants to bake a tasty treat to give her as a get-well present. Her cooking is so tasty that it would make you want to get sick just to have some sweet treats. Should my mom bake cookies or brownies for Hazel?","[cookies] Yummm. Great choice! Cookies are my favorite! Now we have to deliver them to Hazel's mom next door. Their house gives me the creeps. It's kind of spooky. I've never been inside Hazel's house before. Mom has the cookies wrapped up and we're going to deliver them now. Mom gave me the plate of warm, gooey cookies to hold on to. They sure smell good. Should I walk or skip to her house? [walk] Walking is probably a smart idea, especially with all of these cookies. Peter and his mom walked over to Hazel's house with the plate of delicious cookies. ""the house sure is spooky"" thought Peter. The steps to the front door creaked and whined with each step. The front door was huge and a strange green light glowed through the windows. Do you want to knock on the front door or ring the doorbell? [ring the doorbell] Peter was so nervous as his finger pressed the doorbell. ""ooooooh"" the doorbell wailed like ghosts in the night. Peter put the plate of cookies down in front of him and ran around the corner of the house. His little face peered around the corner of the house watching his mother and what might happen to her once the door is opened. The door creaked open as Peter pulled his head back so no one could see him. ""Cookies!"" a woman's voice bellowed. Are those for me?"" Peter could hear the woman eating the chocolate chip cookies before his mom could respond. ""I'm Marge, Peter's mother. We baked these cookies for Hazel. We heard she wasn't feeling well and has been out of school for a while now. Can we give what's left of these cookies to hazel?""I'm Cynthia, Hazel's mother, and these cookies are to die for! Hazel isn't feeling well and isn't allowed to see anyone. I'll give her the cookies and tell her they were from you.""""Not allowed to see anyone?"" Peter thought to himself. That sounds awfully suspicious. I need to find a way into the house so I can see what's really going on with Hazel. I see a door that leads into the ground, a basement I think. It looks awfully scary though and don't know what's down there. Or perhaps I should try to find an open window or door and get into the house that way. Which should I do? Try the door that leads underground or look for an open window? [look for an open window] Which should I do? Try the door that leads underground or look for an open window? [open window] Peter quietly backed away from the door and was unnoticed as he sneaked to the side of Hazel's house. Those cookies are enough to keep anyone distracted.Peter saw a closed window, but perhaps it was unlocked. Peter pressed on the window but it wouldn't budge. Drats! Peter thought. Peter creeped around to the back of the creepy house. Eureka! Their patio door is open. Peter was extra quiet because he didn't know if there was anyone else in the house besides Hazel and her mother. ""If I get caught, not only will I be in trouble, but I could be eaten by a monster!"" Peter pondered. He tip-toed in the door as he looked around at all of the strange, and kinda cool things all over the place. There was a two-headed swordfish mounted on the wall, a rug that looked like it was made from the skin of a unicorn, and a lamp that looks like it belonged to a fortune teller. Tons of old things all over the place. Trinkets and boxes, vases and giant paintings on the walls. Creak. Thud, thud, thud, thud. ""What's that!"" Peter thought as he froze in place. It didn't sound human! What if it's coming for me? What happens next? You'll have to come back later as we release more chapters to Hazel's spooky adventures. Would you like to start the story over or end? [End] Come back tomorrow to start the story over. Just say, ""Alexa, open hazel's spooky adventures"" to open the skill again.",,1 out of 5

B07Z2RRVNV,Mason spooky story," Hey kids! Your mom and dad created this spooky story just for you. On Halloween night, a sister and brother named Addy and Masonwanted to go trick-or-treating by themselves. The children's parents asked them to be home before dark so that they would be safe. ""Scary things happen on Halloween after dark,"" they said, ""so you must be home before the sun sets."" Addy and Mason reluctantly agreed, put on their costumes, and headed out. Addy was dressed as a wicked witch with tangled black hair and a long pointy nose. Mason was dressed as a vicious vampire with sharp fangs and a dark flowing cape. As the children were walking through the front gate, an angry black cat jumped out and startled them.  The cat arched its back and gave a menacing stare before disappearing into the bushes. ""That was strange,"" said Addy , ""I've never seen that cat before."" ""Yeah,"" said Mason , ""we'd better get moving before he comes back."" The children walked from house to house, stuffing their bags with lollipops, chocolate, and other delicious candy. As the sun approached the horizon, they arrived at the last house on the street. Addy and Mason slowly walked up to the house, which looked old and spooky. The shutters were cracked, and the walls were crooked. An empty bowl sat outside on the verandah. The children knocked on the door. A few moments later, the door opened. A small old woman appeared, holding a jet black cat that looked just like the one the children saw earlier. ""It looks like I am all out of sweets,"" she said, ""but I have something special for you two."" Then, she disappeared into the old house. When she returned, she handed the children each a small wooden box. ""Here, take these goodies and get home to your parents."" The children went out the front door and realised the sun had already set. In the distance, they heard the rumble of thunder. Addy and Mason ran all the way home to their parents, who were waiting for them at the door. ""Mom! Dad! We're sorry we're late! We went to the old house at the end of the street and an old lady gave us these boxes!"" The children handed the boxes to their parents. The parents looked at each other nervously and then carefully looked inside. The parents glanced at each other again, this time with a grin, and handed the kids the contents of their boxes. ""Oh no! Said the children. Toothpaste?"" ""See kids! We told you scary things happen after the sun sets!""",,"Tells the exact same story as that of the ""Michael Jackson's Ghost: Meeting Maestro"" but with different character names.",1 out of 5

Ohh I see a new commander here! Let´s start the journey. I will redirect the command to my narrative sister the voice of the earth.

<Short audio>

Hey there commander! Thank you for your time! Let me introduce myself: I am the spirit of the earth. I will guide you through this interactive journey. I am so glad you came to help me rescue our planet out of the claws of the Mukoman. But first of all are you ready to help me? Say ""I am ready""

i am ready

Good! Let me tell you a bit about this journey. The earth as we know it was once a very peaceful, quite and lovely place. But as the human tried to dump their waste in a bad way and not using sustainable powers for their life there was a very bad effect on the earth. But the earth couldn´t do anything against it. So I, the voice of the earth, made a plan to rescue this planet and every human being. I created a human like superhero, captain earth. But I need you to control him. You can control him by giving him commands as the story proceeds. If you want me to show you the captain say ""Show me the captain""

show me the captain

I´m so glad you want to help me save the planet. I will place the captain in different environments where we have to defeat the Mukoman, a bad creature who wants to place garbage all over the earth. We have to stop him! So the first mission is guiding us to the Carribean Islands. I see there is a lot of plastic swimming around the ocean. This is a byproduct of throwing away garbage. Let me tell you a bit about recycling: Recycling is how we take trash and transform it into new products. There are several types of recycling processes that allow some materials to be used one or more times. Recycling is good for us and the environment because it reduces the use of new raw materials to product new products. It also reduces the energy we use, improves the quality of air and water, and fights climate change. Please commander, tell the captain to clean it up by saying ""Clean the water"".

clean the water

Wow! That definitely helped! The dolphins are already swimming again in the ocean and starting a concert to thank you. Good job! The Mukoman has noticed this action and is now hiding somewhere in europe. Let´s fly over and find him! Say ""Fly to europe""

fly to europe

I guess we found him! Look, there is a large machine which is producing plastic and making a lot of polluted air. The Mukoman is laughing because he thinks we can´t stop this now. But hey, do you know the power of reusing? I will tell you a bit about is: Reusing means combining reusing materials and using items that can be reused. For example, paper plates cannot be reused, and reusable cutlery lowers the energy that is needed to make new products, and it also can be reused to prevent more waste in the landfill. Reusing things that can be reused means less pollution and more of our precious natural resources are left intact. Think about the possibilities of a product before you throw it away; it could be reused for another purpose. How about that old t-shirt? It could b used as a car rag. Reuse is different from recycling, but it does lead to reduced consumption – always a good thing. So this is it! We have to tell the people about this, the captain can do this by screaming so loud, everyone can hear it! Tell the captain to do this by saying ""Tell the people about reusing"".

He mixed the water of the river generously with the milk that he sold for a good profit. One day Terry went around collecting the dues in order to celebrate the wedding of his son. With the large amount thus collected he purchased plenty of rich clothes and glittering gold ornaments. But while crossing the river the boat capsized and all his costly purchases were swallowed by the river. Terry was speechless with grief. At that time he heard a voice that came from the river, “Do not weep. What you have lost is only the illicit gains you earned through cheating your customers The moral of the story is that Honest dealings are always supreme. Money earned by wrong methods will never remain for ever.

You're right! Other cats have retractable claws because they are designed for sneaking up on prey, not for speed like the cheetah. Player 2. True or false, The Ancient Egyptians barely used Hieroglyphics?

Welcome, you can say Hello or Help. Which would you like to try?

hello

Here is your story. Once there lived a milkman named Terry. Terry became very wealthy through dishonest means. He had to cross a river daily to reach the city where his customers lived. He mixed the water of the river generously with the milk that he sold for a good profit. One day Terry went around collecting the dues in order to celebrate the wedding of his son. With the large amount thus collected he purchased plenty of rich clothes and glittering gold ornaments. But while crossing the river the boat capsized and all his costly purchases were swallowed by the river. Terry was speechless with grief. At that time he heard a voice that came from the river, “Do not weep. What you have lost is only the illicit gains you earned through cheating your customers The moral of the story is that Honest dealings are always supreme. Money earned by wrong methods will never remain for ever.

Welcome to a poem a day, now will be play a random poem by famous authors such as: Lord Tennyson, Rudyard Kipling or William Shakespeare among others""Sailing to Byzantium"" by W. B. Yeats That is no country for old men. The young In one another's arms, birds in the trees Those dying generations at their song, The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. Caught in that sensual music all neglect Monuments of unageing intellect. An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick, unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress, Nor is there singing school but studying Monuments of its own magnificence; And therefore I have sailed the seas and come To the holy city of Byzantium. O sages standing in God's holy fire As in the gold mosaic of a wall, Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre, And be the singing-masters of my soul. Consume my heart away; sick with desire And fastened to a dying animal It knows not what it is; and gather me Into the artifice of eternity. Once out of nature I shall never take My bodily form from any natural thing, But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make Of hammered gold and gold enamelling To keep a drowsy Emperor awake; Or set upon a golden bough to sing To lords and ladies of Byzantium Of what is past, or passing, or to come. Sonnet 29 by William Shakespeare When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings. I hope you enjoy the poem, would you like to listen another?

yes

""Ozymandias"" by Percy Bysshe ShelleyI met a traveller from an antique land,Who said—""Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;And on the pedestal, these words appear:My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.""I hope you enjoy the poem, would you like to listen another?

yes

If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!"" If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son! When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings. ""Sailing to Byzantium"" by W. B. Yeats That is no country for old men. The young In one another's arms, birds in the trees Those dying generations at their song, The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. Caught in that sensual music all neglect Monuments of unageing intellect. An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick, unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress, Nor is there singing school but studying Monuments of its own magnificence; And therefore I have sailed the seas and come To the holy city of Byzantium. O sages standing in God's holy fire As in the gold mosaic of a wall, Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre, And be the singing-masters of my soul. Consume my heart away; sick with desire And fastened to a dying animal It knows not what it is; and gather me Into the artifice of eternity. Once out of nature I shall never take My bodily form from any natural thing, But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make Of hammered gold and gold enamelling To keep a drowsy Emperor awake; Or set upon a golden bough to sing To lords and ladies of Byzantium Of what is past, or passing, or to come. Sonnet 29 by William Shakespeare When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings. I hope you enjoy the poem, would you like to listen another?

""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" by T. S. Eliot Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question Oh, do not ask, ""What is it?"" Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. ""A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning"" by John DonneAs virtuous men pass mildly away, And whisper to their souls to go, Whilst some of their sad friends do say The breath goes now, and some say, No: So let us melt, and make no noise, No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move; 'Twere profanation of our joys To tell the laity our love. Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears, Men reckon what it did, and meant; But trepidation of the spheres, Though greater far, is innocent. Dull sublunary lovers' love (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit Absence, because it doth remove Those things which elemented it. But we by a love so much refined, That our selves know not what it is, Inter-assured of the mind, Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss. Our two souls therefore, which are one, Though I must go, endure not yet A breach, but an expansion, Like gold to airy thinness beat. If they be two, they are two so As stiff twin compasses are two; Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show To move, but doth, if the other do. And though it in the center sit, Yet when the other far doth roam, It leans and hearkens after it, And grows erect, as that comes home. Such wilt thou be to me, who must, Like th' other foot, obliquely run; Thy firmness makes my circle just, And makes me end where I begun. ""Ozymandias"" by Percy Bysshe ShelleyI met a traveller from an antique land,Who said—""Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;And on the pedestal, these words appear:My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.""I hope you enjoy the poem, would you like to listen another?",,,https://creator.voiceflow.com/creator/privacy_policy?name=Almigi&skill=Poesia%20Espa%C3%B1ola

It had hollow bones, a long flexible neck, long hind legs, and a long tail. Its hands had four fingers each, and its feet had three forward-pointing toes and a dew claw. However, the skull with which its skeleton was crowned did not, unfortunately, belong to Procompsognathus but to either a different dinosaur or a crocodilian. With the spurious skull removed, Procompsognathus' is no longer identified as a coelurosaur. It is now thought to have been a ceratosaur.

It's OK to feel sad. Everyone feels sad at times. After all, if you weren't sad sometimes, it would be hard to know how good it feels to be happy.By the way, since you control your feelings, you can also change them. I'll show you.Let's try something I call, positive self talk. Self talk makes you feel good about yourself and the things that are going on in your life. It's like having a positive voice that always looks on the bright side. Would you like to try positive self talk?

Welcome to Hazel's spooky adventures! You'll get to decide what happens next by making choices throughout the story. So let's get started! My name is Peter and Hazel is my next door neighbor. She's the strangest girl I know! She's always so secretive and wears old, black clothes. I guess she's sick or something because she hasn't been at school for a while. My mom wants to bake a tasty treat to give her as a get-well present. Her cooking is so tasty that it would make you want to get sick just to have some sweet treats. Should my mom bake cookies or brownies for Hazel?

bake cookies

Yummm. Great choice! Cookies are my favorite! Now we have to deliver them to Hazel's mom next door. Their house gives me the creeps. It's kind of spooky. I've never been inside Hazel's house before. Mom has the cookies wrapped up and we're going to deliver them now. Mom gave me the plate of warm, gooey cookies to hold on to. They sure smell good. Should I walk or skip to her house?

walk

Walking is probably a smart idea, especially with all of these cookies. Peter and his mom walked over to Hazel's house with the plate of delicious cookies. ""the house sure is spooky"" thought Peter. The steps to the front door creaked and whined with each step. The front door was huge and a strange green light glowed through the windows. Do you want to knock on the front door or ring the doorbell?

ring the doorbell

Peter was so nervous as his finger pressed the doorbell. ""ooooooh"" the doorbell wailed like ghosts in the night. Peter put the plate of cookies down in front of him and ran around the corner of the house. His little face peered around the corner of the house watching his mother and what might happen to her once the door is opened. The door creaked open as Peter pulled his head back so no one could see him. ""Cookies!"" a woman's voice bellowed. Are those for me?"" Peter could hear the woman eating the chocolate chip cookies before his mom could respond. ""I'm Marge, Peter's mother. We baked these cookies for Hazel. We heard she wasn't feeling well and has been out of school for a while now. Can we give what's left of these cookies to hazel?""I'm Cynthia, Hazel's mother, and these cookies are to die for! Hazel isn't feeling well and isn't allowed to see anyone. I'll give her the cookies and tell her they were from you.""""Not allowed to see anyone?"" Peter thought to himself. That sounds awfully suspicious. I need to find a way into the house so I can see what's really going on with Hazel. I see a door that leads into the ground, a basement I think. It looks awfully scary though and don't know what's down there. Or perhaps I should try to find an open window or door and get into the house that way. Which should I do? Try the door that leads underground or look for an open window?

Are you a bee, a flower, or a bear.

a bee

Great! You are a bee!

<Short audio>

I am a bear.

<Short audio>

The bear collects honey from the bee. I win. I am sorry, bee, you lost this round.

help

The game is bees, flowers, bears. First, I will ask you if you are a bee, a flower or a bear. Just answer by saying a bee, a flower, or a bear. Then, I will take my turn and randomly answer bee, flower or a bear. The rules are that bees collect nectar from flowers, and in this case, the bee wins. This is because the bees get some valuable nectar. Second, bears fertilize the flowers which adds nutrients to the soil. In this case, the flower wins. This is because the flowers are getting some valuable fertilizer, which is food for them. Third, bears collect honey from the bees, and in this case, the bear wins. This is because the bears get some yummy honey. After randomly determining the winner, I will announce our current scores and then tell you an educational fact about bees, flowers or bears. I will then ask you if you would like to play again. If you would like to do so, just say yes. Or, if you would like to stop, just say no. You can also say Alexa, stop, at any time if you wish. When the game ends, I will announce our final scores and the winner of our match. You can play as many times as you like, and I love this game so much I never get tired. Have fun, good luck, and I hope you enjoy playing bees, flowers, bears. Would you like to continue and play the game?

Ok, Here's Goldilocks

Hello! Are you ready to hear about Goldilocks and the Three Bears?

yes

Once upon a time there were three Bears, who lived in a house in the woods. One of them was little, and one was Middle-sized, and one was a Great Big Bear. Now I wonder, do you think these were scary bears, or nice bears?

nice bears

I agree, these sound like nice bears! Remember to always be careful with bears in the woods! Say okay if we should keep going!

okay

Each of the bears had a special bowl for their breakfast, and a special bed to sleep in. One morning they woke up, and saw that it was a beautiful, sunny day outside. What's your favorite thing to do on a sunny day? Do you like to walk, ride bikes, or go swimming?

ride bikes

The bears love to ride bikes too! They jumped out of bed to get ready, but before they could go, they decided to make breakfast, so it would be waiting for them when they got home. Hmmm, what should the bears have for breakfast? Cereal, pudding, or porridge?

cereal

Ok, cereal it is. The bears made their breakfast, and then went outside. While they were out, a little girl named Goldilocks came by their house. She peaked in their window and saw the delicious cereal . She wondered if she should go in a taste the breakfast while the bears were away. Let's help Goldilocks decide what to do. Should she taste the food, or leave and go into the woods?

Ok, pudding it is. The bears made their breakfast, and then went outside. While they were out, a little girl named Goldilocks came by their house. She peaked in their window and saw the delicious pudding . She wondered if she should go in a taste the breakfast while the bears were away. Let's help Goldilocks decide what to do. Should she taste the food, or leave and go into the woods?

taste the food

Goldilocks snuck into the house and tasted the breakfast. She tried a bite from each bowl, and discovered that Small Bear's breakfast was the most delicious. After eating, Goldilocks became tired. She went to explore the house and discovered the bears' comfortable beds. She tried each bed, and discovered that Small Bear's bed was the perfect size for her! While Goldilocks was sleeping, the three bears came home. They saw that someone had snuck in the house, and eaten their breakfast! What should the bears do, should they go back outside, or check the bedrooms?

check the bedrooms

Ok! The bears checked the bedrooms, and when they got to Little Bear’s bed, they saw Goldilocks, fast asleep! Little Bear said, ahem, miss, you’re in my bed! Goldilocks woke up right away! Seeing Little Bear, she felt sorry for eating his breakfast and sleeping in his bed without asking. Mr. Little Bear, she said, I’m sorry for eating your delicious food and sleeping in your comfortable bed. But I would really like to be your friend and come back and visit again. Little Bear appreciated her apology and wanted to be friends too! He told her, Thank you for your apology. We’d love to have you back over for a visit, just let us know before you come in next time! And that's how Goldilocks and the three bears became friends! The end. Thanks for listening to the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears!
