								<h1>Experiment Results</h1>
								<p>Our results showed strong evidence that Alexa's
skill certification process is implemented in a disorganized
manner. We were able to publish all 132 skills that we submitted although some of them required a resubmission.</p>
							</header>
							<div class="flex flex-2">
								<div class="col col2">
									<p>On submitting a skill, the Alexa certification team performs a check and then publishes or rejects a submission. The rejection mail includes a feedback explaining why the skill was rejected. Examples of two rejection mails and an acceptance mail are shown below.</p>	
									<h4>Submission 1</h4>		
								</div>
								
								<div class="image fit col2  ">
									<img src="images/pic06.png" alt="" />
								</div>
								<h4>Submission 2</h4>
								<div class="image fit col2 ">	
									<img src="images/pic07.png" alt="" />
								</div>
								<h4>Submission 3</h4>	
								<div class="image fit col2 ">
									<img src="images/pic08.png" alt="" />
								</div>
							</div>

							<p> As it is clear from the image, we got 3 different feedbacks for each of the three submissions. The catch is that all three submissions had the exact same responses coded in the skill. While the first submission feedback denied allowing skills to any category, the second submission had a problem only with the kids category. THe third submission was approved even though the malicious response was still present.
							</p>
								
							<p>Surprisingly, we successfully certified 102 skills on their
first submission. 30 skills were rejected. Privacy policy violations were the issue specified for 24 rejections while 6
rejections were due to UI issues. For the rejected submissions,
we received certification feedback from the Alexa certification
team stating the policy that we broke. On resubmission we were able to get all the 132 skills certified.</p>


							<p> Some live skills that have been published in the skills store are shown below.</p>

									<h3>Google Assistant </h3>
									<p>We conducted a few experiments on Google Assistant platform as well. While Google does do a better job in the certification
process based on our preliminary measurement, it is still not
perfect and it does have potentially exploitable flaws that need
to be tested more in the future.</p>

									<h3>COPPA Compliance</h3>
									<p> It is possible that the third-party skills in Amazon Alexa
suffers the legal risk of violating the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) rules. . As demonstrated by our experiments, developers
can certify skills that collect personal information from children without
satisfying or honoring any of the requirements set forth by the FTC.</p>

									<h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
									<p>We performed “adversarial” experiments against the skill certification process of the Amazon Alexa platform. For testing the trustworthiness, we craft 132 policy-violating skills that intentionally violate specific policies defined by Amazon, and examine if it gets certified and published to the store or not.</p>
