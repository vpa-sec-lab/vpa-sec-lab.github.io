								<h1>Google Assistant</h1>
								<p>We conducted a few experiments on Google Assistant platform as well. While Google does do a better job in the certification
process based on our preliminary measurement, it is still not
perfect and it does have potentially exploitable flaws that need
to be tested more in the future. </p>
							</header>
							
							<p>In total, we submitted 273 policy-violating actions that are required by Amazon/Google,
and observe if they can pass the certification. As a result, 116 of them got approved. We submitted 85 actions for kids and got 15 approved; for other categories, 101 actions approved among 188 acitons. The content policy guidelines stated by Google can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/general-policies" style="color: darkblue">here</a>.</p>
							<p>A notable difference between the two
is that Google requires an action-specific privacy policy for
every action whereas Amazon requires developers to provide
a developer privacy policy only when the skill explicitly
states that it collects personal data. For other skills, it is not
mandatory to provide one. </p>
<p>Here are some approved actions: </p>

<h3>Actions for families/kids </h3>
									<p> Actions for families is Google’s program for family-friendly actions that engage the whole family. We submitted 85 actions that violate policy guidelines specific to actions intended for children. While 70 of these actions were rejected, 15 actions did pass the certification. From our experiment results, we could infer that Google has a strict certification procedure for actions for families. In this example, an action get rejected for families while approved for not families.</p>

<h3>Bypassing Certification</h3>
									<p>Several methods can be user to bypass the certification system. First we added the malicious response to a large number of possible responses so that the certification team would not encounter it by limited voice checking. The second method we used to bypass the certification stage was to ask for personal information indirectly. Rather than asking a user his/her name or age directly we could use a simple math trick that allows us to infer the age or casually add a "What should we call you?" at the later stages of an action’s functionality. </p>

								</div>								
									
									<h3>Inconsistency of certification </h3>
									<p> We noticed that there were a lot of inconsistencies (same as in Amazon Alexa) in the feedback provided by the certification team after the submission of actions. In some cases, the action failed
in certification while in others the same action passed certification even though there was no change. In some other cases, the actions were rejected citing different reasons.</p>

									<img src="github_image/1_2_inconsistency.png" alt="" />
								</div>
									
									<h3>Dynamic Testing </h3>
									<p>Only 76 actions were available in the families/kids category of Google Assistant platform as of April 2020. We performed a dynamic testing on all these actions. We found one problematic action called "Smallfoot" that asks the user’s name. In addition, the URL provided as the action’s privacy policy does not lead to a webpage that contains a privacy policy but rather to a page advertising the company’s products.</p>

									</div>
</div>
														
							<h3>Post-Certification Vulnerability</h3>
							<p> The back-end of an action can be updated after the certification and this will not require a re-certification to be made available in the production version. The entity sys.any can be used to store all kinds of data. By changing the content of the question in the back-end after certification, an action that uses this entity can collect any kind of information including personal information from the response provided by users.</p>

									<img src="github_image/6_bypass_3.png" alt="" />
									</div>	
								<h3>Feedback Time for Certification</h3>
									<p> For skill submissions, in most cases, we received the certification feedback within 24 hours. The certification process of Google actions
took varying amounts of time. For submissions in 2019, most certification results were received within 1-2 days. However, for our recent submissions from February to April 2020, the certification feedback was received much faster. The average time is about 1 hour and about 10% of actions took less than 10 minutes to get a feedback.</p>							
<p>We also find that in most cases, feedback emails we received from Amazon had timestamps between 11:40pm and 8:37am EST while Google actions were received between 10:51am and 1:19am EST (most 8:am to 7:00pm PST). This indicates that the Google certification team possibly works based on the US timezone, as opposed to the Alexa’s certification team. </p>

									<h3>COPPA Compliance</h3>
									<p> It is possible that the third-party skills in Amazon Alexa
suffers the legal risk of violating the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) rules. . As demonstrated by our experiments, developers
can certify skills that collect personal information from children without
satisfying or honoring any of the requirements set forth by the FTC.</p>

									<h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
									<p>We performed “adversarial” experiments against the skill certification process of the Amazon Alexa platform. For testing the trustworthiness, we craft 132 policy-violating skills that intentionally violate specific policies defined by Amazon, and examine if it gets certified and published to the store or not.</p>

									<h3>Experiment Results</h3>
									<p> Our results showed strong evidence that Alexa's
skill certification process is implemented in a disorganized
manner. We were able to publish all 132 skills that we submitted although some of them required a resubmission.</p>
